This

<h2>IV: 5 Steps for Experimental Research</h2>
<p>
<ol><li><font color="green">Form a Hypothesis</font></li>
<p> After deciding upon a hypothesis, and making predictions, the first stage of conducting an experiment is to specify the sample groups. These should be large enough to give a statistically viable study, but small enough to be practical.

Ideally, groups should be selected at random, from a wide selection of the sample population. This allows results to be generalized to the population as a whole.

In the physical sciences, this is fairly easy, but the biological and behavioral sciences are often limited by other factors.
</p>
<li><font color="red">Divide Sample Group into Control Group</font></li>
<p> The sample groups should be divided, into a control group and a test group, to reduce the possibility of confounding variables.

This, again, should be random, and the assigning of subjects to groups should be blind or double blind. This will reduce the chances of experimental error, or bias, when conducting an experiment.
</p>
<li><font color="blue">Determine Time Scale and Frequency of sampling</font></li>
<p> This stage of conducting an experiment involves determining the time scale and frequency of sampling, to fit the type of experiment.

For example, researchers studying the effectiveness of a cure for colds would take frequent samples, over a period of days. Researchers testing a cure for Parkinson's disease would use less frequent tests, over a period of months or years.
</p>
<li><font color="orange">Conduct the Experiment</font></li>
<p> The penultimate stage of the experiment involves performing the experiment according to the methods stipulated during the design phase.

The independent variable is manipulated, generating a usable data set for the dependent variable.
</p>
<li>Gather and Analyze your Data</ol></li>
<p> The raw data from the results should be gathered, and analyzed, by statistical means. This allows the researcher to establish if there is any relationship between the variables and accept, or reject, the null hypothesis.
</p>
